							I remember I was so frustrated in the Kata challenge especially the Super Fizz-Buzz one, I was so confused on what to do that I decided to drop it for the day and come back later just so I can relieve some stress, my teacher always told me if you are stuck in some sort of challenge, skip it, then do the other ones and if you are stuck on those come back to the previous answer to see if something click, and if nothing happens just take a quick break like a 2-5 minute break, I don’t know about others but it work well for me, especially during the exams and tests I had during highschool.
						<br>
						<br>
							But this isn’t highschool, I can take a long break if I want to, did I do that?..........yes, should I have done that?, probably not I certainly don’t advise this, because when I got back to it my brain just couldn’t handle it anymore. I did a bit of the Kata challenge but got stuck for way too long, so I decided to look at some of the peoples solutions I found online, I went through all of them to make sure I understand what the heck I am supposed to be doing. Nope nada, I understanded their inputs and structuring but not the function itself like how the function was set up, this caused me more confusion cause I wasn’t expecting everyone’s function to look like they did, I thought it was supposed to be simplified and for my eyes it wasn’t, for them it probably was, I was this close to giving up on the Kata Challenge altogether but I somehow kept my mind focused and still continue on, until I had enough and just asked my facilitator to explain how their answer match the challenge.
						<br>
						<br>
							After a long hard hour for me, I don’t know about joseph though,he was just cruising the whole time understanding everything he was talking about, he simplified it so much that even a person who had no knowledge about coding or if they didn’t understand what a computer was knew what that function did, I’m so grateful to him because I think it took me 2 days for me to complete that certain challenge that’s how annoying it was for me personally, but I’m glad I finished it, cause even though I didn’t complete it myself, I was still happy because someone was there to help me. I have finally understanded/grasped the knowledge of how an array function worked and how it processes it in the console log. I was just super confused because it was trying to gather the array from the whole test and it just overloaded my brain with unnecessary things that weren't relevant whatsoever.
						<br>
						<br>
								I tried debugging the code via error message but that was the problem, it wasn’t like a test where you answer something one by one like the previous two and throughout my highschool years, that’s what I’ve been taught my life and somehow it just became a habit for me. I was supposed to construct the whole function instead of writing the same but functions over and over again, I knew that deep down but for some reason I just didn’t implement that into my brain cause I thought it was unnecessary but boy was I wrong.
						<br>
						<br>
							After the call with JO$EPH I learned how to properly implement debugging codes with/via using the console.log. I knew how to do it but not the way he was using it. It made it some much easier for me to understand what the function was doing after he showed me the way he used console.log, it is probably what you are supposed/meant to do but I was so focused on the error message that I thought that it wouldn’t do me good if I were to use console.log during that time, now I know that it is never bad to be using that command on a regular.
