							I always thought that I wasn't going to struggle at all but look at me now, 
							even though I did that online course it didn't really amount to that much to be honest.
							I struggled alot which was probably something new. <br><br>
							I also definitely learned on how to program with others pretty good too,
							I did the minesweeper and the js carnival with one of the cohorts members and
							it was a joy to do it with them too, I appreciated every single second I spent with them.<br><br>
							another one that I learned was how to work or focus in a more efficient way,
							I used to be distraced by the most tiniest thing but now the only thing that could ruin my learning is either,
							people talking loudly or calling my name from across the room, I also have got a bit better via trying to study using music.
            <br>
						<br>
							I know that when I finished the foundations and will try to get ready for the bootcamp, I know that I will struggle
							alot, because for this sprint I had a real challenge my way, even though I didn't finish most of them I will gradually finish them,
							making sure that I have understood both the language and the components behind it,
							which is my problem at the moment, I understand how the code is running but I just need to figure out how to
							properly structure the code to make sure that it's A: either making it work or B: I understand it.
							I understand that empathy will become a must within the bootcamp because, who doesn't love
							a positive and a warming place to hang about whilst coding?. 
            <br>
						<br>
							what probably surprised me the most about core learning is how efficient developing
							your human skills will be for the up-coming future of a web developer,
							and I can see why too, also the neuroplasticity is again an important benefactor when it involves coding.
							for me I like to think of myself as a pretty understanding guy,
							the only problem I will probably have when coming into this bootcamp would be "when will it be ok to ask an appropriate question?,
							because what if I don't understand what he said at all, do I ask the teacher to repeat himself/herself or ask after?.
							but yeah that is my main concern when it comes to the human skills, since I don't want to waste my
							cohorts time with the teacher answering alot of my questions within one lecture,
							when they could be doing something productive with their time, like coding
            <br>
						<br>
							the most difficult part of the sprints was easily either the minesweeper and the wack-a-mole game that we had to create.
							I had to have a few of my cohorts and JO$EPH to come help me with most of it because I got absolutely lost during it.
							By asking for help this enhanced my learning by a whole bunch, and the most important thing was that, I haven't wasted too much time
							by simply doing that single thing, if you need help, ask for it, but for me it is only when I am truly stuck :)
            <br>
						<br>
							the answer would be simply why not?, this is an amazing skill to have, especially in an enviroment where things could get heated pretty easily,
							I fully agree with EDA's idea and full heartedly (dont know if I spelt that right), the idea of having both
							a friendly and positive environment this easily increases the participation/effort levels when coming into the bootcamp.
						<br>
						<br>
							I have a mixed feeling about this question, because I feel like it is an important anttribute to have and a invaluable skill too,
							who doesn't want to be treated in a positive way?, especially in an environment where there will be a lot of errors,
							but I also think that we should have done a bit more coding just because for me at least I really found it satisfying when I completed a hard challenge,
							but there were also times where I didn't know what I was doing at all because for me, I found enjoyment of coding with JO$EPH through
							watching the video EDA has put up really entertaining and I would watch him code and then would make an exercise of my own to make sure I have nailed
							that part of the challenge done, especially with the fizz_buzz challenge, I was almost about to give up with it.
