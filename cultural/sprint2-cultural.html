  			<p class="content-header">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</p>
  			<p class="sub-content">My goal would be to, be able to help my parents with different type of coding like javascript, and helping them along the way, while I hone my skill I would also really like to become either a front-end developer or maybe even a back-end developer so I can work on the servers or even create cool apps like my father did once.</p>

  			<p class="content-header">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
  			<p class="sub-content">I would like to hopefully have my motivation levels rise up which so far it is working wonder, I am really enjoying these challenges even though the css grid part of the course and styling my blog using css grids almost made me cry. Other than that my I’ve been super pumped and excited for the next part of the sprints.</p>

			 <p class="sub-content">Another thing would be my participation levels which sort of relies on motivation but since I left school I wasn’t really that motivated to do almost anything unless it was compulsory like family time traveling and stuff like that, throughout this course I kind of have been changing my habits like how I used to sleep in super late, ruining my health eating super poorly, but now I have a set time where I go to sleep and wake up like a proper working class sleeping schedule. Waking up early and working almost 8 hours a day, the funny part is I’m actually kind of enjoying it too. I feel much happier than before, to be able to work beside my parents while they can help me if there is a bug in my coding.</p>

			<p class="content-header">A description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
  			<p class="sub-content">My limitation is that I can’t work to my full potential if there are distractions in the room, for example people chatting in the background, or music. But if working in groups I am able to give my 100% even if there are people that I don’t know, because I have left that old habit behind.

			<p class="sub-content">Another strength would be that I am very understanding if there is criticism coming my way like if I made a mistake or need to improve upon something I will do it without waste.</p>
			<p class="sub-content">One of my limitations at the moment would be that if I work for way too long I tend to get a bit side-tracked and lose focus on what I’m supposed to be doing, but by doing this course I’m increasing my attention span and also my motivation levels really well.</p>

			<p class="content-header">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>

  			<p class="sub-content">Of course when the bootcamp starts I will be giving my all towards my classmates and my facilitators, at the moment I’m improving my health with all these new tiny habits I’ve been picking up throughout the first 5 week of the programme, so when the bootcamp starts there will be now problem with me being unmotivated. I am really chill with anyone. I’ve lived by the rule of treating someone one the way you want to be treated, this has helped me make a lot of friends throughout my life and I’m grateful for it too. The same goes for the other person if they are nice to me of course I’ll be friendly back, but if it is unnecessary hate then I tend to avoid it, unless it is constructive criticism from my peers then I will make sure I use those to better whatever needs work, may it be from myself or just coding.</p>

			<p class="content-header">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
  			<p class="sub-content">I usually ask my facilitator for anything that I don’t understand throughout the course, but so far I’m content and don’t really need help at the moment with coding unless it was with the grid section of css, but I’ve completed that challenge. But if there are any other problems in the future I will make sure that I ask my classmates only if they aren’t busy themselves.</p>

			<p class="content-header">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</p>

  			<p class="sub-content">To be kind, constructive and helpful throughout the course. Of course shout-out to Joseph Quested. He is doing a bang-up job in being my facilitator and I’m really enjoying our calls whenever he needs to check up on me.</p>

  			<p class="content-header">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</p>
			
  			<p class="sub-content">I don’t think I will be having too many block-out times since I will be mainly making this course my primary focus through-out to the end. But if it is necessary like a funeral I’ll probably need to spend a bit of time with the family or the family of the deceased, other than that I think there shouldn’t be any problems with blocked out schedule, unless I’m super sick and can’t even walk straight, and so I don’t make the whole class sick too. I could wear a mask but I don’t really think that wearing the common mask really helps unless it is one of the hazard suit masks where everything can’t get it or get out.</p>

  			<p class="sub-content">Also I apologize but I feel more comfortable structuring it like this instead since it is easy to look at and I could always reflect back on it whenever I feel like to see if I completed my promise.</p>
