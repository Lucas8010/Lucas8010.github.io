  			<p class="sub-content"> I remember back in my highschool days we were nearing the end of term 3 or 4 I think, where I was supposed to get pizza for my group for the class since the teacher decided we deserved it after all of us did an outstanding job as a class, they said meet at the pavilion at the beginning of lunch so that the teacher and those who were supposed to buy the pizza would meet and go together, I asked where the pavilion were but I got vague responses like over there, by this place etc, and since I was too timid to ask for directions I just winged it, by the time I searched around I found one my class member asking why I haven’t gone with them yet, I asked I didn’t know where to go and that apparently they left like 20 minutes ago.</p>
			<p class="sub-content">So I decided that I would go to Pizza Hut instead of wandering around, by the time I got there it was 10 minutes past lunch and I was still waiting for my order. I was so scared that I screwed up so bad and that everyone would hate me, another 10 minutes pass and I finally get my pizza, again I was too timid to ask for help from the pizza place to help me take 7 boxes of pizza back, but somehow by my timid nature he asked if I wanted to take the pizza bag to help me carry them but for some reason I froze and just said no and just asked for plastic bag, and how awful of an idea that was, I remember carrying them vertically squishing the pizza and ruining it instead of the horizontally, but I still decided to go back even though it was ruined.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">When I got back I saw my group standing outside the pavilion in the scorching hot weather because of my lack of competence and my personality, I think I lost some acquaintances. Cause I would get super mad too if someone was in charge of getting pizza comes back around 30 to 40 minutes later with my pizza while we are in the sun boiling because of a mistake they did and only too find out that the pizza that I ordered not only was some-what watery since the steam latched on the inside of the plastic bag, was also in ruins because I remember when one of them picked up their box half the cheese got stuck to the top of the box, the rest of the class was chilling up top cheering for me but I knew it was a sarcastic cheer, after that I don’t think none of them wanted to talk to me ever cause I got so much hate I heard from one of my other mates who hangs out with one of the dudes in my group, he asked if they knew me and my mate hyped me up saying how I was one of the bros etc, just for him to end up saying how much of an idiot I was and all these mean things about me. I also tried apologizing but again I was too much of a coward and couldn’t come to terms with it so I just tried shaking it off as the time went on.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">I remembered how bummed out I felt about that, but one of my mates said that their class didn’t even get pizza and those who did had to share with the rest of the class. When he told me that I didn’t feel as bad as I did before since they still got their pizza, ‘somewhat’. When he told me that I kinda felt relieved that someone was also in the same boat as me or maybe worse.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">I reflected back at my mistakes and decided to stop being that way, stop being so compacted and try to ask more instead of taking everything on by yourself. I then thought if they were booted outside because of my mistake and I come back empty handed I think it would of gone down 50 times worse than when if I came with pizza so I’m kind of glad I decided to take that alternative even though it costed me a couple of friends in the future since you could not be able to trust me with the simple task of getting pizza just because I didn’t ask for directions and it wouldn’t surprise me too I fully agree with them but at least because of the guilt I carried I made sure I got them their pizza to make up for my lack of competence instead of abandoning it all and make them absolutely loathe me.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">I think because I was the only brazillian kid in my school out of thousands I felt really out of place since everywhere you go it was everyone of the same ethnicity paired up with everyone or just people that attended the same primary school so I was basically lonely for at least around a week or 2, some people came up to me and gave me a high five or shook my hand but I think that was out of pity since I was never asked to hang out with them during interval breaks, then again if my younger self was only a little more self confident they probably would of accepted me in their group. I tried to find what they enjoyed and see if I can try and enjoy what they enjoy so that I would be able to have conversation and not be lonely.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">Being brazilian I was grown up to be in love with football and yes I do enjoy football a whole bunch more than other sports but coming to new zealand I was also grown up by their favourite sport, rugby, since I was a pretty skinny kid I would almost try to never play it since it was out of my comfort zone, unless it was ripper rugby, that was super fun cause it required a lot of focus and it didn’t prefer those of a higher muscle mass. Looking back it I always preferred if things were on my favour and not the other, but as time went on I actually am super disappointed at my younger self for not challenging himself, and now I absolutely adore having something challenging approach me, cause every time I complete that set challenge the feeling of satisfaction is an amazing feeling to have and it makes you want to complete more and improve on yourself.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">With this almost all the limitations I had in learning disappeared, cause I remember if something was too hard I would leave it to the very last day and I would get so tired that I grew up disliking these type of things, but only later on I figured out how truly awful this can affect my future self. With these in mind I decided to change these habits little by little so that my conscious could get used to it and not become a tedious process which would make me stick to my old habit.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">I usually stopped procrastinating at this point in time, since I usually like to do a few things through the course of the week instead of leaving it to the last day but I think that if I usually stick to my routine on taking my time and making sure I do and understand what I wanted/need to do throughout the week I will be exceptionally prepared for the upcoming journey ahead.</p> 

			<p class="sub-content">Another obstacle that usually I had problems with was introducing myself and asking for advices and of tackling everything by myself, this usually caused me to be mentally drained and frustrated since I had so many things piled up in there like unnecessary information that didn’t correlate to what the question even was, and that made me super frustrated and un-enjoyable whenever it came to challenges but now it won’t be a problem.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">I wasn’t really an active person back in my school days, I didn’t really contribute much whenever we had a group activity to do unless I was with people that I knew cause I was too scared to say anything, I remember when we had to do a class brainstorm and I wrote something down and I overheard someone make fun of it and I immediately deleted it.</p>

			<p class="sub-content">But I remember back when we had to create some custom tactics for a game of flag football our team were arguing because they didn’t like the play each-other were proposing, they started bickering until one of them had enough and just sat on the field like he didn’t care anymore. I decided to step in and tell them to understand each others point of view try some practice drill everyone splitting into a team of two and then we decide to replicate both of their tactics to see which one was better, funny enough both of their tactics weren’t even that good they were basic and easily see-through, I suggested an idea to integrate both of their tactics and improve upon it, after that instead of our team always losing and coming last we became second, the team that we lost to, their captain was the captain of the 1st XV who won trophies nationally and regionally. I was pretty proud of myself and mostly our team who gave it their all too.</p>
