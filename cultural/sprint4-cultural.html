   						<p class="sub-content">With the principle of Neuroplasticity, the amount of effort and knowledge increases in oneself, for example the power of imagination vs the power of action. Though the imagination and action are directively two separate mechanisms they aren’t really that far apart in similarities, research explains how one’s thinking capability is almost as great as one’s action. For example a study conducted from a neuroscientific standpoint has concluded that the power of imagining an action and actually performing the action require the exact same motor and sensory programs in the human brain. What does this mean?, well if there were someone who watched a whole bunch of professional athletes for example do some sort of exercise or skill, they could grasp the knowledge visually and adapt to it in their mindset. With this if they were to perform these visual representation into an action they would be able to learn that certain skill much quicker than those without the use of the imagination factor.

						Neuroplasticity is also capable of helping through mental disabilities like anxiety. Study shows that neuroplasticity can trigger these connections towards the human brain by simple certain brain activities throughout life. These can vary through natural flight or fight reaction which means whenever someone has an anxiety attack its due to a definitive position occuring at that time a.k.a atmosphere, object, time, place and much more. Because of this your brain establishes these connections which builds up stress/anxiety.
					<br>
					<br>
						You are still able to break these connections by simply changing your habits. Which can reduce the amount of stress you build up leading to further improvement of mental health. Meditation is also a good way to relieve these connections too, “A study conducted by the University of Wisconsin showed that meditation naturally and beneficially increases the brain’s “gray matter” by harnessing the potential of your brain’s neuroplastic.”. The “Gray Matter” consists of the majority of one’s brain neurons and is greatly associated in the brain's “Sensory Perception”. Which is the way someone is able to see, feel, communicate, remembering a memory from the past and much more.
					<br>
					<br>
						So how does this benefit me, well it literally can benefit anyone. For me I used to watch some Youtube videos on for example football skills and watch how cool it used to look and visualize those moments, their body structure, the fluidity of their movements and apply that in real life and oddly enough it worked wonders, but it did take a little while for it to develop, it didn’t just happen spontaneously obviously, but it did help accelerate the process on how long it would of taken me without the help of videos.
					<br>
					<br>
						As discussed by a number of scientist the best way to increase one’s neuroplasticity is to repeatedly practice and activity or further access one’s memory, this can cause the neurons on the brain develop new lengths of one’s mindset like helping them master a party trick or mastering a whole new different language by just simply listening. This creates an electrochemical pathway in our brain which basically shapes throughout the period of learning new and challenging obstacles.
					<br>
					<br>
						But what would happen if one would stop practicing these new things?, of course these neurons would die out or begin to erase themselves due to the lack of learning or progression. 
					<br>
					<br>
						If you allow yourself to continuously perform these exercises for the brain like learning how to juggle this causes different neurons to work together much more efficiently and stronger, which overtime these newly formed neuron become a solid and effective navigation link that connects to the various parts of the human brain. So the more practice the more stronger these neurons will become which will sometimes make that certain memory one is striving for permanent

						What is exactly a growth mindset?. This allows the person to challenge themselves and strive for their well-being. This is one of the most important core in oneself, this helps develop life changing experiences in itself. Having a growth mindset means you are more willing to advance through bad experiences and learn from them. This helps those who struggle to learn and further forward their path.
					<br>
					<br>
						Study from a psychologist Carol Dweck in her TED Talk shows that a group of kids were to take a hard test above their knowledge for an experiment. This led some students to cheer as they loved a challenge, they were super ecstatic about it, wanting a better challenge to forward themself or just to have a bit of fun. But some others resorted to cheating since they thought it was too difficult for themselves, this is called a FIXED MINDSET. since they weren’t willing to learn like the others they directed themselves to this path because they did not want to look dumb infront of the other students. Whilst if they did the test and fail they would seek-out others who did as bad or worse than them to make them feel a bit better.
					<br>
					<br>
						Because of this it is better to always look in towards facing challenges because they will help through-out life and clear the obstacles in your way. This helps our brain develop sort of like neuroplasticity development. How when we feel like it's too hard we don't try and then later on we still prevent ourselves from taking that extra step to reach our goal which prevents ambition and further progresses the mental health mentality issue. 
					<br>
					<br>
						The one thing that surprised me was how simple and positive words like “you’re amazing at this” or ‘you’re bad at this” can really affect someone’s mindset. Due to criticism they are likely to give up on that exercise and would ignore anything related to that exercise whilst those who take criticism and uphold it can learn from it and better themselves at it.
					<br>
					<br>
						By learning from my fellow classmates and students, I’ll tackle challenges that are hard and will ask my classmates help or look up online the proper way to complete this if it proves to be too hard for a one person job.
